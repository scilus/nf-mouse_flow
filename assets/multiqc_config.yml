    description: |
      This section contains QC images for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metric
      maps. Add specifications regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the DTI metrics, ensure that FA highlights major white
      matter tracts with expected high values (e.g., corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, etc.)...

    section_name: "Registration QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the registration of the diffusion data to the
      anatomical space. Add specifications regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the registration, ensure that the diffusion data is well aligned
      with the anatomical data and that there are no significant misalignments or distortions...

    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the tracking of the diffusion data. Add specifications
      regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the tracking, ensure that the streamlines are well-defined and
      follow expected anatomical pathways without excessive crossing or noise...
