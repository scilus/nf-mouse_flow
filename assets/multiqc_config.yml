      RGB map from RAW data versus RGB map after gradient correction. Corpus callosum should be in red.
      ### **Using the option use_preqc is highly experimental. Please be careful.**

  pre_qc_sampling_mqc:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "PRE QC - Raw/Optimized Sampling"
    description: |
      Gradient sampling scheme from RAW data (left) and optimized gradient sampling scheme with the same number of directions as RAW data (right).

  dti_qc:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "DTI QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metric
      maps. Add specifications regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the DTI metrics, ensure that FA highlights major white
      matter tracts with expected high values (e.g., corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, etc.)...

  registration_qc:
    file_format: "gif"
    section_name: "Registration QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the registration of the diffusion data to the
      anatomical space. Add specifications regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the registration, ensure that the diffusion data is well aligned
      with the anatomical data and that there are no significant misalignments or distortions...

  tracking_mask_qc:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "Tracking Mask QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the tracking mask of the diffusion data. Add specifications
      regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the tracking, ensure that the streamlines are well-defined and
      follow expected anatomical pathways without excessive crossing or noise...
