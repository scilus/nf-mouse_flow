custom_data:
  pre_qc_rgb:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "RGB PRE QC"
    description: |
      This section contains RGB images from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 
      To assess the orientation of the quality of the data, make sure the CC is in red corresponding to a left/right connection.
    plot_type: "image"

  pre_qc_shells:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "Shells PRE QC"
    description: |
      This section contains a sphere image showing the distribution of the gradients. 
    plot_type: "image"

  dti_qc:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "DTI QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metric
      maps. Add specifications regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the DTI metrics, ensure that FA highlights major white
      matter tracts with expected high values (e.g., corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, etc.)...

  registration_qc:
    file_format: "gif"
    section_name: "Registration QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the registration of the diffusion data to the
      anatomical space. Add specifications regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the registration, ensure that the diffusion data is well aligned
      with the anatomical data and that there are no significant misalignments or distortions...

  mask_tracking_qc:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "Mask Tracking QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC seeding and tracking images the diffusion data. 
    plot_type: "image"

  tracking_qc:
    file_format: "png"
    section_name: "Tracking QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the tracking of the diffusion data. Add specifications
      regarding how to evaluate those images, for example:
      To assess the quality of the tracking, ensure that the streamlines are well-defined and
      follow expected anatomical pathways without excessive crossing or noise...
